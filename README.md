Used KMeans algorithm to cluster ipl players. From the clustering i have drawn useful insights.I got the dataset from kaggle which contains data from 2008 to 2022
I got inspired from https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-to-cluster-cricket-players-1d53beeb69b4.
I learnt about clustering and how to find useful insights from the clusters by visualisation using seaborn
